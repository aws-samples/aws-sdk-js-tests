Code Sample for testing AWS JS SDK

### Steps to test:

- Fork this repo, and clone your fork
- Create a local branch in your workspace
- Add the code for testing AWS JS SDK v2/v3
- Push code to remote branch on your fork, and share the code for reproducing

### Example test for data returned by DynamoDB client:

- Checkout master branch: `git checkout master`
- Run `yarn` to install dependencies

#### Node.js:

- Update REGION in [`src/shared/config.js`](./src/shared/config.js)
- Run `node src/node/index.js` to run both v2 and v3 clients in Node.js
- Note that responses returned by clients will be printed in console

#### Browser:

- Go through the following steps if you don't have resources created
  - [Create a Amazon Cognito Identity pool for testing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-started-browser.html#getting-started-browser-create-identity-pool)
    - Note down REGION and IDENTITY_POOL_ID
  - [Add a Policy to the test Unauthenticated IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/getting-started-browser.html#getting-started-browser-iam-role)
    - The policy should be specific to the operations you want to test
  - Update the REGION and IDENTITY_POOL_ID in [`src/shared/config.js`](./src/shared/config.js)
- Run `yarn start:dev` to start webpack-dev-server with HMR, which opens a bundle in default browser and updates the browser when changes are made

#### React Native:

- Follow steps in browser section to create and update REGION and IDENTITY_POOL_ID
- Run `yarn start:react-native` to start local server for react-native app
- Refer webpage to test in iOS simulator, Android device/emulator etc
